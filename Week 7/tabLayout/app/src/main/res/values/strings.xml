    <item><![CDATA[I have been listening to her songs since I was around 10 years old, during my elementary school days!
        I used to really like "Red" and "22", but now I think my favorites are "The Way I Loved You," "You Belong with Me," and "Enchanted."
    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[I have known her since we were 13. She was covering Ed Sheeran(s) song "Perfect," and I immediately fell in love with her voice.
        Because we are the same age, thatms when I started idolizing her.
    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[I have idolized him ever since he released his song "Love in My Pocket." He is Indonesian but based in the USA under the 88rising label.
        I knew about him before, but after "Love in My Pocket," I started following him closely. I even learned English because of him!

            <item><![CDATA[Of course, when I started senior high school, two songs by Nadin Amizah became popular, and surprisingly, I loved them even though her music genre usually does not fit my taste!
        Until now, I still love her and her song "Star" the most.
    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[I have really loved her since I found a singing video of her covering the song "I Love You, You'll Know It." Her voice is so unique and calming!
        And then I discovered her song "Lugu," and now I am a big fan of her music!    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[EXO is definitely the boy group with the most stable voices! I adore them! My favorite song is "Walk on Memories"!
        My bias is Baekhyun and Chanyeol! I love their jokes and how fun they are.
    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[NCT DREAM is the cutest group on this list! I love them because I discovered their song "We Go Up" and immediately became a fan of Nana with his pink hair!
        The songs I love the most from them are "Life is Still Going On" and "Beautiful Time."
    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[The first time I saw her was on TikTok with her amazing song "Lose." I started following her and was surprised to find out she is under the 88rising label just like Rich Brian.
        I still love her song "La La Lost You"!
    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[I have been listening to his songs since elementary school! I used to sing his songs all the time and enjoyed his voice so much!
        I loved the song "Sepatu" back then, and nowadays, I am obsessed with "Interaksi."
    ]]></item>
            <item><![CDATA[I fell in love with his song "Waktu yang Salah"! Everyone knows that song. I started following him and discovered that he is a writer, songwriter, and singer!
        So fascinating. And I still love the song "Waktu yang Salah" to this day.
